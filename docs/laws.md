# All the laws

## Newton's laws of motion

1. An object's velocity will remain constant unless acted on by an external force
2. Force ‚àù rate of change of momentum: $$F ‚àù \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$$
3. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction: ü§úü§õ

## Kirchhoff's laws

1. Current into a point = current out of the point, i.e. $$I_{in} = I_{out}$$
2. Total EMF = Total PD, i.e. $$\Sigma\varepsilon = \Sigma V$$

## Ideal gas laws

### Boyle's law

Volume is inversely proportional to pressure (I think) (with constant temperature)

### The other one

Pressure is proportional to temperature (I think) (with constant volume)

## Kepler's laws of planetary motion

1. Planets orbit in an ellipse, with the sun at one focus
2. The area swept out by any planet during a given time period is constant
3. $$T^2 ‚àù r^3$$
